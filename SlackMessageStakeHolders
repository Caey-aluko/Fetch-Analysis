Hi Team,

During my analysis of the receipts, users, and brands data, I identified a few areas where we can improve data quality to ensure accurate reporting:

Missing Brand Links: Some receipt items reference brand codes not present in our Brands table. This affects spend attribution.

Orphaned Receipts: A number of receipts don’t link to valid users, potentially skewing user-based metrics.

Item Count Mismatches: Several receipts have a purchased item count that doesn’t match the actual items listed.

Questions for Clarity:

How are brand codes assigned to receipt items? Could there be legacy codes?

Should orphaned receipts be excluded from analyses?

Are there known issues with receipt scanning that could explain item count mismatches?

Next Steps:

Collaborate with engineering to validate data ingestion pipelines.

Clean up stale brand codes or add missing entries.

Implement validation checks during data entry (e.g., valid user IDs).

Looking forward to your insights to refine our approach!
